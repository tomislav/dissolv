# Dissolv for macOS

[Download on Mac App Store](https://apps.apple.com/app/dissolv/id1640893012 "Download on Mac App Store")

Dissolv takes care of clearing away window clutter in the background as you work. By hiding the applications you're not using, it helps keep you distraction free and focused on the stuff that matters.

Set a global time to hide all applications after they haven't been activated for that period of time, or set custom settings for specific applications.
